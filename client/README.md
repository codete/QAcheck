##### Running a server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

##### Troubleshooting
`'Ng' is not recognized as an internal or external command` - please install `@angular/cli` - `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`.

##### Building production version
To create `production` build run `ng build --prod`. Your build will be created under `./dist` directory.
