Here you can find examples how to use api library.

#### SERVER URL
Change if necessary `SERVER_URL` in class `com.codete.regression.examples.AccountConfig` to point to your localhost server (or any other server instance that you have access to)

```$xslt
public static final String DEFAULT_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8080";
```

#### API KEY
To run any test you need to provide your personal `API_KEY` (you have to configure it in `AccountConfig` class). If you don't have `API_KEY` please register on the server application and you will receive your personal key.
